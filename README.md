# Client-Server-Development
CS-340 Portfolio item.
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs starts with organizing code into logical, modular components. For example, in Project One, I created a dedicated CRUD Python module to handle all interactions with the MongoDB database. This separation of concerns made it easier to test, debug, and reuse code without duplicating logic. By isolating database operations into a single class, I ensured that changes to the database schema or connection details would only need to be updated in one place, enhancing maintainability.

This modular approach paid off in Project Two, where the same CRUD class seamlessly connected the dashboard widgets to the data model. It allowed the Dash application to focus on user interface and interaction logic, while the CRUD module handled data retrieval. One major advantage of this method was the ability to rapidly adjust filters and views in the dashboard without touching the database code. In the future, this CRUD module could easily be reused in other applications that need access to the same data—such as command-line tools, reporting scripts, or automated data syncing.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I reviewed the data structure and client requirements, then designed a modular plan: one module for data handling, another for dashboard logic. Compared to previous coursework—where assignments were often more linear—this project required more attention to system architecture, data integrity, and user interaction design. I learned the value of building scalable and testable components early, especially when developing applications intended for real-world use.

To design future databases for other clients, I would begin by understanding their data needs and workflows, then choose technologies that offer the best trade-off between flexibility, performance, and scalability. I’d also prioritize validation, data cleaning routines, and user-friendly access layers like APIs or visual dashboards.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing systems that are efficient, logical, and useful. Our work often sits behind the scenes, but it powers the tools and decisions that organizations rely on. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, my dashboard empowers the team to quickly identify animals suitable for different types of rescue missions. This means less time manually sorting records and more time focusing on what matters in a real life scenario saving lives and placing animals into roles where they can thrive. Projects like this bridge the gap between data and action—and that's where computer science makes a lasting impact
